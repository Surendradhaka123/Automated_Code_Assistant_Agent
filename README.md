# Code Assistant Agent

## Overview
This Code Assistant Agent is designed to generate, validate, and improve code iteratively using a graph-based architecture powered by LangGraph. It leverages Mistral's large language model for structured code generation and incorporates self-correcting mechanisms to refine outputs within a limited number of iterations.

## Architecture and Approach
The agent follows a structured approach to ensure reliability and efficiency:
- **Graph-Based Execution:** Uses LangGraph for managing execution flow.
- **State Management:** Tracks conversation history, generated code, error states, and iteration counts using `GraphState`.
- **Structured Code Generation:** Implements `Pydantic` models to ensure proper formatting, including imports, main logic, and documentation.
- **Validation Pipeline:** Implements a two-stage validation process to check:
  - Import errors
  - Code execution errors
- **Output Capture:** Redirects `stdout` to capture execution results and print statements.
- **Memory Optimization:** Retains the original user question and the most relevant recent context.

## Design Assumptions
- Code solutions are self-contained and executable.
- Maximum **three iterations** for self-correction to prevent infinite loops.
- User queries are primarily focused on Python programming tasks.
- Code solutions include necessary imports and a complete implementation.

## Key Features & Potential Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- More granular error categorization.
- Implement strategies for handling different error types.
- Syntax validation before execution.

### Safety and Security
- Implement sandboxed code execution.
- Add timeout mechanisms for long-running code.
- Incorporate input validation and code sanitization.

### Expanded Capabilities
- Support for multiple programming languages.
- Automated unit test generation.
- Memory retention for previously successful solutions.

### User Experience Enhancements
